                "Established in 1988, the Srinagar School of Management (SSM) was the first step towards the privatization of technical education in JandK state. Since its inception, the management of this institute has had considerable experience in the field of technical education. Although the institute started as a polytechnic housed in a rented building, thanks to visionary leadership, it grew into an engineering college on its campus only a decade later, with a large land on a green scenic hill with a calm and serene eco-friendly environment. The environment near the famous 12th-century historical Parihaspora city is only 20 km away from the capital Srinagar. Apart from extensive institutional infrastructure, the institute has two large hostels and a huge fleet of buses and light vehicles for the convenience of students and staff.\n\nThe board of the institute consists of respected educators/administrators/technocrats, and highly trained professionals whose leadership is available to the institution. The Principal, HODs, Faculties, and Staff are responsible for establishing and upholding the core objectives, core values, and ethical principles that guide our College. Plans of the college are designed keeping in mind the vision and mission of the institute. For the service of humanity, the institute is committed to creating and disseminating knowledge in the field of technology and management."
